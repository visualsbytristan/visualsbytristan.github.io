        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm Tristan, a 20-year-old cinematographer and video creator with a deep passion for crafting captivating visual stories. My filmmaking journey began in high school when I first discovered the art of editing, and what started as a hobby quickly transformed into my life's passion and career.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power of storytelling lies in the fusion of creativity and technical expertise. From the early stages of conceptualization to the final touches in post-production, I am hands-on at every creative process step. Whether it's capturing breathtaking scenes behind the camera, refining the narrative through editing, adding depth and emotion with colour grading, or directing talent to bring a vision to life, I approach each project with unwavering dedication.
        </p>
        <p>
        My ultimate goal is to create world-class videos that leave a lasting impact on audiences. I've honed my skills in cinematography and animation, directing, and various aspects of videography. I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of storytelling, continuously seeking innovative ways to engage viewers and evoke emotion through my work.
        </p>
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>
            A passion for storytelling drives my video production workflow through visuals. Whether it's crafting engaging advertisements, capturing the magic of weddings, or producing talk shows, I follow a meticulous process. It all starts with finding inspiration in the project's essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pre-planning, precise filming, and post-production excellence are vital components. Together, we shape videos that not only meet but exceed expectations. My diverse portfolio reflects this commitment to excellence across various project types, all with a common goal: to create impactful and memorable videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          A client-centric philosophy guides my workflow. Understanding the unique vision and goals of each project is paramount. I prioritize effective communication to ensure that every video aligns perfectly with the client's objectives and resonates with their audience. The result is a dynamic and versatile video production process that consistently delivers exceptional results, regardless of the project's nature or scale.
