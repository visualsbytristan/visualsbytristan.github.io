					<p> Over the past 5 years, I have sat down with men & women who are eager to take a leap into getting to know their identity and style. </p>

					<p> Fashion for me is all about exploring and having fun with style. I don't believe in following any rules or trends. The way to know your authentic is digging deeper into your style story and getting to the core of your heart.</p>

					<p> At Leap Into Style, I walk alongside people to help rediscover their identity through Christ. There is something powerful when the transfomation is from God. </p>

					After her assessment, she provided objective insights about my fashion issues. She could see through me and propelled my inward journey of recovery and healing towards my body and dressing. As it turns out, my tendency to cover up and purchase larger sizes, was a revelation shared by Nicole!

					Nicole taught me to make space for my personality and not be held down by 'fashion' standards that are not suitable for me. She stressed the importance of being comfortable in my own skin - how to wear the clothes and not let them wear me.
