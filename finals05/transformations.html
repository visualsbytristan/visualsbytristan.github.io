				Leap Into Style with Nic, was nothing sort of a miracle for me. Nicole exuded such warmth and empathy, whilst engaging me in a series of in-depth questions. After her assessment, she provided objective insights about my fashion issues. She could see through me and propelled my inward journey of recovery and healing towards my body and dressing. As it turns out, my tendency to cover up and purchase larger sizes, was a revelation shared by Nicole!
			</p>
			<p>
				She taught me to dress accordingly to my size and not based on my preconceived thoughts/notions. It was really practical but always eye opening.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ms. Limon's personality and expertise enabled me to see my curvy body, as one that can wear trendy and age appropriate clothes. Her knowledge in utilizing colors, textures, prints, and accessories really made me understand how to dress for my body type, thus reflecting in my confidence. My style really did come back to life, and the joy in dressing up has been ignited! I get to express my confidence and zest to live life, once again! I am incredibly grateful for all your partience and support in my journey, Nicole Limon!
			</p>
			<p>
				More power to Leap Into Style! God bless you, Nicole!
