			<h1> Meet Nicole </h1>
			<p class="details">
				Over the past 5 years, I have sat down with men & women who are eager to take a leap into getting to know their identity and style.

				Fashion for me is all about exploring and having fun with style. I don't believe in following any rules or trends. The way to know your authentic is digging deeper into your style story and getting to the core of your heart.

				At Leap Into Style, I walk alongside people to help rediscover their identity through Christ. There is something powerful when the transfomation is from God.

					Our session reminded me of so many things. My style coaching with Nicole wasn't just about improving my appearance but it was more importantly about the things of the heart. Grateful for Nicole and everything she does for others through her unique life + style coaching.
